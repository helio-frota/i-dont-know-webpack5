*At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.*
([source](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/))

Build reasons:

* Bundling the code
  * Simplify deployments
  * Improve performance
* Transform the code
  * Allow use of modern code structures
  * Transform TS to JS to use supported features while using latest features.
* Add assets
  * Images, fonts, css, etc.
